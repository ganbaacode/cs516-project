Microservices approaches aren't all a bed of roses. Having a mix of languages and frameworks can be hard to support and, without strict discipline, can lead to confusion down the road. Eventual consistency, coordination, discovery, and complex error recovery can make thindifficult in a microservice universe.

Software engineering is always a game tradeoffs. Beacause something in fashion ( like microservices ) doesn't make it usually right for all problems and use cases. What matters is knowing about the different architectural options, understanding their pros and cons, and, importantly, understanding the requirements and needs of your own problem. ( And yes in some case of situations, having monolith is OK.)
