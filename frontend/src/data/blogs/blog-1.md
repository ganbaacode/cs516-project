Early on, around the time of the first conference on serverless technologies and architectures (https:/ / serverlessconf.io) in 2016, there was talk that serverless technologies foreshadowed the era of NoOps. Some people believed that thanks to serverless, companies would no longer need to think about infrastructure operations.

The cloud vendor will take care of everything was the thought. That assumption, that NoOps was a real thing, proved not to be the case.

When it comes to building and running serverless applications, DevOps engineers are essential, except now they have a different focus. Their attention is on deployment automation, testing, and working with the operations/support teams of their preferred cloud provider (rather than tweaking servers and patching operating systems).
Companies can get away with smaller, more specialized DevOps teams; however, ignoring operations entirely is a recipe for disaster (and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise). Remember, when your application fails, customers hold you accountable, not your cloud provider, so be ready and have the right people and processes in place.
